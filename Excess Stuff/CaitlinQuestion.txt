Hey, so I want to ask you something I've been wanting to ask for a while now and I haven't because I don't want to cause any problems between us or make things awkward in any way.

I apologise in advance I'm still shit with words, I've never done this before and I've written this out like 4 times because frankly I didn't have the courage for this any earlier. Which is why this is a few days outdated

I want to ask you out properly(future spiders and all), the time I've spent with you over the last 5?(at least) weeks i think by now, have truly been some of the best times I've had in a while, if not ever. You're amazing, funny, cute as anything and way better than anyone I should have a chance with(Don't try and dispute that, we both know it's true and I know I've said a lot of this before but i'm slightly unimaginative and it's just how i see things). No matter how many reasons you tell me I wouldn't want to date you they haven't worked and never will.
So if there is a chance for something there I want to try and take it, whether this is now or in the future that all depends on you, I don't want it to feel like I'm pressuring you into anything because I'm leaving this completely up to you with how this goes. If there's not something like that there that's fine as well, I just figure it's best to ask, find out for definite, deal with whatever happens after and hope nothing goes overly wrong from me doing this
