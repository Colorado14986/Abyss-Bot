So bit of background my mum has been pretty majorly depressed for at least a year maybe more, was on medication for a while but gave up on it after not that that long.
Whenever I'm not in my room become effectively a mobile venting room and sounding board for everything she finds upsetting or frustrating, which at this point is everything in her life, from neighbours, to work and not wanting to go back in, to covid, to anything major happening in the news which she's unfortunately begun doing since covid began, so government incompetence and more recently the mess in Afghanistan. 

Now, I don't have the best control over my emotions, anger specifically and I never really have done so, but with with being consistently yelled to (not at, but still feels the same) and told how much she wants to kill herself over the last while I find myself getting more and more angry at it each time it happens, to the point where I can't stand talking to her and end up yelling back which only makes things worse for both sides. She's pushed away all of her friends, and our last like 2 remaining relatives, even if it wasn't intentionally so it ends up just being me that gets dumped with it, which causes even more issues half the time because she wishes she had "another adult" to talk to, which in the foreseeable future can only be me or the damn dog, neither of which fill that criteria so that causes problems as well.
And I'm fully aware I shouldn't be annoyed at a person suffering like she is for trying to vent this kind of out, but I don't know how to handle it most of the time, or how to give any advice for it as It's not something I've experienced, nor have i experienced most of the topics she is angry about, so then I feel helpless, she gets worse and the cycle continues endlessly as she has no intentions of seeking help, as she hates going outside now and can't be out for any length of time without stressing out and being unable to cope with any small set back that occurs and for most wouldn't cause that much of a negative effect.

I just can't stand  the feeling I get where I know I'm getting irrationally angry at it, and the helplessness that comes from hearing literally the only close family member i have say they want to kill themselves every couple days and actually mean it. And of course I can never vent about it because no one I talk to irl would care or I just don't want to air out her issues to people as I don't feel that's my right to do, which is why this will probably never be sent anywhere and why in in the channel people won't choose to use most of the time.
